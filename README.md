# ZMDepth
We present the first monocular fisheye camera depth estimation dataset for parking lot scenes, called ZMDepth.

# Dataset overview
Our dataset is captured by driving in numerous parking lots in a large-size city, shanghai. It contains over 80,000 depth maps in total. We will initially release a partial dataset of 6,510 images after privacy anonymization for the benefit of community. It contains 6,000 images for training and 510 images for testing and covers all four surround-view fisheye cameras.
